In this project, I implemented various ways of generating random values:
Even distribution:
1. The method of the Middle squares
2. Method of the Middle Works
3. The Mixing Method
4 .Linear Congruent Method
Normal distribution:
1. The central limit theorem
2. Mueller's method
3. The Monte Carlo Method
